        My name is Usaid Ali. I am a highly motivated individual who's just coming to the end of a 24-week coding bootcamp at the University of Birmingham. In hopes of switching careers. I've been working in the retail and security industry and am now hoping to start my journey as a software develepor.

        My first inkling to going into development began when a few of my relatives had been recently accepted in jobs with a coding focused role. One which was using a form of software in which he tested out different looks for model cars for the company polestar. I thought that was very interesting and began my reserach into software development and came across the course run by UoB.

        Throughout this bootcamp i've honed my coding skills via multiple weekly challenges and a some group projects.This experience has been priceless for me as it has helped me get the basics of coding down whilst also improving other skills which i believe to be integral in any workspace environment such as communication skills and problem-solving.

        I am excited to see what the future entails as there are endless possibilites when it comes to software development. The advancement of AI is impressive, and the potential for innovation in areas like machine learning, data analysis, and web development is vast. I am eager to apply my newfound skills and knowledge to real-world projects and contribute to the ever-evolving field of technology.

        In my previous roles in the retail and security industries, I have developed strong communication skills and a keen attention to detail, which I believe will be valuable assets in my transition to software development. I am accustomed to working in fast-paced environments and am adept at adapting to new challenges and technologies.

        As I embark on this new journey, I am committed to continuous learning and growth. I am enthusiastic about expanding my skill set, collaborating with talented individuals, and making meaningful contributions to innovative projects. I am open to new opportunities and am eager to explore different areas within the field of software development.

        Overall, I am excited about the prospect of starting a career in software development and am confident that my passion for technology and dedication to learning will drive me to succeed in this dynamic and rewarding field.
